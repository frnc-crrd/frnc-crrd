# Francisco Carriedo
**Software Engineer | Actuary | Technologist**

I exist at the intersection of **quantitative rigor** and **hacker curiosity**. I don't just write code; I architect resilient systems, harden infrastructure, and accelerate Time-to-Market through rapid, high-fidelity prototyping.

## The Philosophy

My workflow is defined by a relentless pursuit of efficiency and security.

* **The Builder's DNA:** My daily driver is **Fedora**, and I manage my own hardened **Ubuntu LTS** servers. I believe in understanding the stack from the kernel up to the cloud.
* **Risk-Aware Engineering:** Leveraging my Actuarial background, I treat software architecture as a risk management problem. Every dependency is a liability; every test is an insurance policy.
* **Augmented Velocity:** I specialize in integrating **LLMs** into the SDLC, reducing boilerplate to focus on complex logic. I use technology to compress delivery cycles without sacrificing quality.
* **The Standards:** TDD is non-negotiable. If it isn't automated, it's broken. I build Event-Driven Microservices designed for infinite scale and zero-trust security.

## The Lab & The Stack

I am constantly experimenting with network configurations, self-hosted services, and new paradigms.

| Domain | Current Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Languages** | Python (Advanced), C# (.NET), TypeScript, SQL, Bash |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Linux Hardening (Fail2Ban/Auditd) |
| **Architecture** | Event-Driven (AWS SQS/SNS), Serverless, Microservices |
| **Data** | PostgreSQL, DuckDB (In-Memory Analytics), Redis |
| **Tools** | GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Neovim/VS Code, Local LLMs |

## Signature Engineering

**[PrivaSee BI Ecosystem]**
*A self-hosted, zero-latency analytics engine.*
* **Innovation:** Decoupled OLTP/OLAP using DuckDB to bypass enterprise data warehousing costs.
* **Performance:** Sub-second rendering of millions of records via Python-native architecture.

**[Serverless OCR Orchestrator]**
*Event-driven document ingestion pipeline.*
* **Scale:** Asynchronous processing of burst workloads using AWS Lambda.
* **Security:** Full IAM governance and PII redaction workflows.
